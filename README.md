# Application Deployment with Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, and Kubernetes

This project details the end-to-end deployment of a simple React application to a production-ready state on AWS. The solution utilizes a modern CI/CD pipeline built with Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, and Kubernetes.

##  Repository Structure

The project repository contains all the necessary files for a full CI/CD pipeline.

  - `dist/`: The pre-built static assets of the React application.
  - `Dockerfile`: Defines the container image for the application.
  - `Jenkinsfile`: The declarative pipeline script for Jenkins.
  - `kubernetes/`:
      - `deployment.yaml`: The Kubernetes deployment manifest for the application.
      - `service.yaml`: The Kubernetes service manifest to expose the application via a Load Balancer.
  - `terraform/`:
      - `main.tf`: The Terraform configuration to provision all AWS infrastructure.
  - `.gitignore`: Specifies files to be ignored by Git.
  - `.dockerignore`: Specifies files to be excluded from the Docker build context.

##  Deployment Architecture

The deployment process follows a standard CI/CD workflow:

1.  **Version Control (Git):** The application code, Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, and Kubernetes manifests are all managed in a Git repository.
2.  **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):** Terraform is used to provision all required AWS resources, including a VPC, an EKS cluster, and a Jenkins server on an EC2 instance.
3.  **Containerization (Docker):** The React application's static assets are packaged into a lightweight Docker image using a multi-stage `Dockerfile`.
4.  **Continuous Integration (Jenkins):** Jenkins is configured with a pipeline that:
      - Pulls the latest code from GitHub via a webhook trigger.
      - Builds the Docker image from the pre-compiled `dist` folder.
      - Pushes the tagged image to DockerHub.
5.  **Continuous Deployment (Kubernetes):** Jenkins applies the Kubernetes manifests to the AWS EKS cluster, deploying the new Docker image and updating the application without downtime.
6.  **Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana):** An open-source monitoring stack is deployed to check the health and performance of the EKS cluster and the application.
